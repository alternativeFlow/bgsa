<p>I encourage all students (especially 1st year grads) to attend this meeting and to consider signing up for any of the positions. But even if you are not interested in being involved in planning of BGSA activities, feel free to join the meeting anyway! It is a great opportunity to meet new people, share your thoughts… :) Unfortunately, this year we cannot eat pizza together, but we can fuse the BGSA meeting with lunch break, so we don’t waste our limited and precious time for lab work.</p>

<p>Here are the positions that we will go through in the meeting:</p>

<p>EXECUTIVE: President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer</p>

<p>BGSA REPRESENTATIVES: Grad Rep. to Faculty Meetings, TA Union Rep. (CUPE 2278), GSS Councilor, Wellness Committee</p>

<p>ORGANIZING COMMITTEES: Student Symposium, New Student Orientation, Christmas Party</p>

<p>OTHER FUN EVENTS..?</p>

<p>If you would like to nominate yourself or another student for an executive position, you can let me know by email prior to the meeting or let us know in the meeting that you would like to be considered for the position. For more information about a position’s responsibilities etc. send me an email and I would be happy to provide it for you.If you cannot attend the meeting, but you have questions/ideas/concerns, please let me know (radojicicana.bio@gmail.com).</p>

<p>See you on Wednesday, and may the force be with you!</p>

<p>Ana Radojičić</p>

<p>BGSA president</p>
